# Nanny in a Flash Front-End App

[Hosted here](https://nanny-scheduler-fe.anthonykizer88.now.sh/)

# About
Nanny in a Flash helps a busy parent. Between work meetings, PTA meetings, Board meetings, you barely have time for yourself, and when you do, finding that right child care provider can be difficult. That's where Nanny in a Flash comes in. As a parent, you can log in, select a nanny based on availibility, location, or what services they can offer, and then request their services.

## Setup
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and has the following dependencies:

### [FORMIK](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/overview#installation)
```
npm install formik --save
```
### [Yup](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/overview#installation)
```
npm install -S yup
```
### [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
```
$ npm install axios
```
### [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
```
npm install node-sass
```

## File Path Structurer
Most files of interest will be found in the standard ```src/components``` folder in self explanatory folder names such as ```auth```which contains the: Login, Logout, Register forms. Or ```layout``` which contains the display components: Dashboard, Home... ```navigation``` which contains the NavBar.... and so on.

The exception to this rule is the ```src/contexts``` which contains the components that call the back-end data though the required APIs.

And, the ```src/SASS``` folder which contains the build if the included sass styles.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
